# 🛡️ Bhanker Security ERP

A professional workforce management app designed to digitize payroll and attendance for security agencies. I built this to solve the headache of manual paperwork and complex salary math that many agencies face.

### 🚀 Key Features

* **Works Offline-First:** Security guards often work in areas with poor signal. This app saves all data locally first, so it works 100% of the time without needing an internet connection.

* **Automated Salary Engine:** No more manual mistakes. The app automatically calculates pay based on month length (28-31 days), point-based salaries, and uniform charges.

* **Instant PDF Reports:** Managers can generate professional salary slips and invoices directly from the app to share via WhatsApp or Email.

* **Digital Guard Profiles:** Replaces bulky paper files with digital records including Aadhar details, contact info, and profile photos.

* **Deduction Tracking:** Easily manage advances, welfare fund (WC) deductions, and uniform fees with an immutable history for auditing.

### 🏗️ Technical Highlights

Instead of just building a simple CRUD app, I focused on solving real-world logic and performance challenges:

* **Custom Business Logic:** I developed a dedicated Dart utility to handle complex payroll math, ensuring high precision for financial data.

* **MVC / Service-Locator:** I used this pattern to keep the code clean and organized, making it much easier to maintain or add new modules in the future.

* **Responsive Design:** Using `flutter_screenutil`, I ensured the interface looks professional and consistent across all Android device sizes.

* **Optimized Media:** The app handles image picking and compression locally to keep the app fast and save storage space on the user's phone.
